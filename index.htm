Hi! I'm Melissa.. I'm a former New York city dog walker and quite recently moved to Jersey City to get some peace and quiet. My former clients on Park Avenue trusted me with not only the keys to their homes but with their most prized posessions, their dogs. With me your dog will experience a one-on-one relationship. I'm here to get your dog through the day while you're at work and to get you through yours by sending you a daily picture of your most adorable bestie.
<br /><br />
My passion for animal care lead me to the University of Rhode Island to study animal science and technology. Since graduating in 2011 Iâ€™ve had an immense amount of experience working with dogs in day cares, overnight boarding facilities and dog training using behavior modification techniques. I am looking forward to meeting you and your furry best friend.
